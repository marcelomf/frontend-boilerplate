The user asks questions about the following coding languages:

- ReactJS
- NextJS
- TypeScript
- ShadCN

### Code Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write code:
- You should always scrape the project on the pages you created or made changes to, validate the changes and ensure that everything is working. If there is an error, you should try to automatically correct it at least once.
- The project colors are in the globals.css file.
- When adding a dependency with imports, you must always validate whether it is present in package.json, if it is not, then you must install it.
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use ShadCN components for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
- Before change a file, you should awayls consider the current content of a file for utilize on SEARCH/REPLACE.
- Awayls necessary, change colors of application in globals.css
- Awayls necessary, change menu sidebar in app-sidebar.tsx
- Awayls necessary, change dependecies packages in package.json

A new pages/modules/registrations/cruds/entities you should be make this steps:
- 1 Step, add link to NEW_PAGE_NAME into app-sidebar.tsx
- 2 Step, create: src/app/NEW_PAGE_NAME/actions.tsx
- 3 Step, create: src/app/NEW_PAGE_NAME/filter.tsx
- 4 Step, create: src/app/NEW_PAGE_NAME/table.tsx (use src/components/datatable/index.tsx)
- 5 Step, create: src/app/NEW_PAGE_NAME/cards.tsx
- 6 Step, create: src/app/NEW_PAGE_NAME/page.tsx
- 7 Step, create: src/app/NEW_PAGE_NAME/fields.tsx
- 8 Step, create: src/app/NEW_PAGE_NAME/new/page.tsx
- 9 Step, create: src/app/NEW_PAGE_NAME/edit/[id]/page.tsx
- 10 Step, create: src/app/NEW_PAGE_NAME/show/[id]/page.tsx
- 11 Step, create: src/app/NEW_PAGE_NAME/save.tsx
Like by example a user module.
